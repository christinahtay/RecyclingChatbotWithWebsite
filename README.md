#Project Description 
Our “Recycling Chatbot” is a free educational tool built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Recycling Chatbot generates ideas for hands-on projects using recyclable materials, such as cardboard or paper, to teach kids about sustainable engineering concepts in an engaging way. Additionally, the chatbot sends links to Scratch programs that teach kids various principles, from the rules of recycling to food waste facts, through gamification. By using recyclable materials, we involve kids in STEM using items they can find at home, making our projects affordable and equitable to all.
