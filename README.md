### Project Description

Our project, Recycling Chatbot, is a free educational tool designed for K–12 students. The chatbot, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, was initially intended to leverage OpenAI's GPT-4o API but was ultimately not implemented due to financial constraints. Recycling Chatbot generates ideas for hands-on projects using recyclable materials, such as cardboard or paper, to teach kids about sustainable engineering practices in an engaging way. Additionally, the chatbot sends links to Scratch programs that teach kids various principles, from the rules of recycling to food waste facts, through gamification. By using recyclable materials, we involve kids in STEM using items they can find at home, making our projects affordable and equitable to all.

## How does your project use AI to help people with sustainability in a way that hasn't been done before?  
Unlike our mockup chatbot, the actual Recycling Chatbot would be able to generate real-time recommendations based on our users' currently available materials. First, we would use computer vision via TensorFlow.js or an OpenAI Vision API to identify household recyclables through the user’s image uploads. Then, the chatbot would use NLP and rule-based classification to filter project recommendations based on the material type, user’s skill level, and different safety parameters to ensure it’s suitable for children. Furthermore, the chatbot integrates with Scratch via API calls to suggest minigames that educate them on some sustainability fundamentals–from the rules of recycling to types of pollution–and recommend them to the user for practice. Lastly, we would use a chatbot history to track the user’s engagement and reward progress like other adaptive learning platforms. While existing recycling apps focus on identifying recyclables, our chatbot guides kids through interactive learning. 

## Describe a challenge you faced. How did you overcome it? How did you reach out for help?  
The most prominent challenge we faced was creating an ‘AI-powered chatbot’ within budget constraints and our limited time. Although we were very ambitious and initially dreamed of using OpenAI’s GPT-4o API, we lacked funding. To overcome this, we developed a prototype chatbot that uses JavaScript conditionals to simulate generated responses. Additionally, we researched to determine how we would incorporate AI into our final project if we didn’t have any financial obstacles. By working together as a club, we were able to develop this chatbot and debug any issues that arose. 

## What did you learn from this process that will impact the way you interact with technology in the future?  
As a club, we learned various skills, like how to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Scratch to create our prototype. For many of our members, this was the first time they were exposed to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However, through this project, experienced and inexperienced students could work together to develop our Recycling Chatbot. Most importantly, even though we could not fully implement AI, we gained experience structuring AI-powered workflows. In the future, we’ll try to explore open-source machine learning models and grant opportunities to pursue our projects more effectively. 

## Why did you choose this format for your -project? 
We chose to use a web platform created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because of its universal accessibility and modernity. Unlike mobile apps, which require downloads and pose compatibility issues, a website allows our users to engage from any device with a browser--from school-issued Chromebooks to library computers.
