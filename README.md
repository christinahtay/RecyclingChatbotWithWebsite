## Project Description
Our “Recycling Chatbot” is a free educational tool built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Recycling Chatbot generates ideas for hands-on projects using recyclable materials, such as cardboard or paper, to teach kids about sustainable engineering concepts in an engaging way. Additionally, the chatbot sends links to Scratch programs that teach kids various principles, from the rules of recycling to food waste facts, through gamification. By using recyclable materials, we involve kids in STEM using items they can find at home, making our projects affordable and equitable to all.

# How does your project use AI to help people with sustainability in a way that hasn't been done before?
Unlike our mockup chatbot, the actual Recycling Chatbot would be able to generate real-time recommendations based on our users' currently available materials. First, we would use computer vision via TensorFlow.js or an OpenAI Vision API to identify household recyclables through the user’s image uploads. Then, the chatbot would use NLP and rule-based classification to filter project recommendations based on the material type, user’s skill level, and different safety parameters to ensure it’s suitable for children. Furthermore, the chatbot integrates with Scratch via API calls to suggest minigames that educate them on some sustainability fundamentals–from the rules of recycling to types of pollution–and recommend them to the user for practice. Lastly, we would use a chatbot history to track the user’s engagement and reward progress like other adaptive learning platforms. While existing recycling apps focus on identifying recyclables, our chatbot guides kids through interactive learning. 

# Describe a challenge you faced. How did you overcome it? How did you reach out for help?
The most prominent challenge we faced was creating an ‘AI-powered chatbot’ within budget constraints and our limited time. Although we were very ambitious and initially dreamed of using OpenAI’s GPT-4o API, we lacked funding. To overcome this, we developed a prototype chatbot that uses JavaScript conditionals to simulate generated responses. Additionally, we researched to determine how we would incorporate AI into our final project without any financial obstacles.
